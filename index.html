        <p>I have found a new passion that I strive to make into a new career. I was first introduced to coding in
            2022
            and I instantly fell in love with it. The challenge of solving a problem through technology is very
            exciting
            to me.</p>
        <p>My goals for this training are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn Web Development</li>
            <li>Become efficient in HTML, CSS, JS and the other technologies</li>
            <li>Collaborate with other developers</li>
        </ul>
